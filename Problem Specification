The proposed <b>E-Commerce Database Management System</b> is designed to manage online shopping activities by efficiently handling customers, sellers, products, categories, carts, orders, order items, payments, addresses, and reviews. The system stores customer details such as name, email, phone number, date of birth, and a derived age, and allows each customer to maintain multiple addresses. Sellers are registered with their basic information and can sell multiple products, while each product belongs to exactly one seller and one category. Product details include product name, brand, MRP, and stock availability, and categories are used to classify products for easier browsing. Customers can add products to a shopping cart, where item total and grand total are derived values. When a customer places an order, details such as order date, shipping date, order amount, and order status are recorded. The many-to-many relationship between orders and products is resolved using the OrderItem entity, which stores quantity and MRP for each product in an order. Payments made by customers are recorded with payment mode and date of payment, and each payment corresponds to exactly one order. Customers can also submit reviews for products, including ratings and descriptions. The system enforces referential integrity using primary and foreign keys, avoids redundancy through derived attributes, and provides a structured and normalized database design suitable for an e-commerce platform.
