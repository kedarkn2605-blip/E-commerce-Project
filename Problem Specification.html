The proposed <strong>E-Commerce Database Management System</strong> is designed to manage online
shopping activities by handling customers, sellers, products, orders, payments, and reviews efficiently.
The system stores <strong>customer details</strong> such as name, email, phone number, date of birth,
and a derived age, and allows each customer to have <strong>multiple addresses</strong>. Sellers are
registered with basic details and can sell multiple products, while each product belongs to exactly one
seller and one category. Product information includes product name, brand, MRP, and stock status, and
categories are used to classify products. Customers can add products to a <strong>shopping cart</strong>,
where item total and grand total are derived values. When a customer places an order, order details such
as order date, shipping date, amount, and status are recorded. The <strong>OrderItem</strong> entity
resolves the many-to-many relationship between orders and products by storing product-wise quantity and
MRP. Payments made by customers are recorded with payment mode and date, and each payment corresponds
to a single order. Customers can also submit <strong>reviews</strong> for products, including ratings
and descriptions. The system maintains <strong>referential integrity</strong> using primary and foreign
keys, avoids redundancy through derived attributes, and ensures a structured and normalized database
design suitable for an e-commerce platform.
